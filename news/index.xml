      <description>Heathen Foray played the Orpheum Newcomer Bandcontestâ€œ last sunday.
We reached the 2nd place of the audience-voting with 82 votes! We just came 7 votes after the 1st place. Therefore we won&amp;rsquo;t be playing the next round of the contest.
We want to thank all our friends and families that supported us so well. Through your support it feels like a victory to us! Our special thanks go to our friends of Arctic Light, Contra/Verse and Interregnum who supported us throughout the show.</description>

      <description>First of all, we have some bad news: We were not able to enter the studio this January because of some private issues . So the DEMO Release will be postponed to the end of March. We are confident that it will be ready till then.
And now some good news: Heathen Foray will be playing some gigs this spring. Exact dates are not fixed by now but we will let you know on our homepage as soon as they are fixed.</description>

      <description>We are sorry to inform you that Rigor Mortis can&amp;rsquo;t play at the &amp;ldquo;On the Battlefield&amp;rdquo; festival in Deutschlandsberg. Nevertheless the organisators found a more than fitting replacement. Verreck Attack will perfom instead of Rigor Mortis.
We are looking forward to see you on the 9th of December!</description>

      <description>First of all we want to thank you for the wonderful feedback on our homepage! A lot of people asked us for samples of our songs. Unfortunately you have to wait till the turn of the year. After that we will enter the studio a record our first Demo CD. There will be of course some samples for you on our homepage!
The reason why we cannot record the songs earlier is our first liveperformance on the 12th of December at the SUBWAY Deutschlandsberg.</description>
